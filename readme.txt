Hello, this is the final project in MNXB01. 

To run this code, simly start root inside the folder namned "code", then everything will be automatically compiled. To see plots showing some interesting illustrations of the weather in Lund, execute "project()" in root. The inputs for the functions creating the plots can be customized in file "project.cpp".

(FYI: Some of the dates for the commits is not correct since the clock 
in the virtual machine has been stopped during "save machine state" 
and therefore been put several days behind in some cases. 
However, the history for the merge pull requests should be okey.)
